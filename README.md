# ELT with Spark for Preparing NLP data on Snowpark

## Project Overview
The explosion in popularity of language models means that feeding correctly processed clean data is more important than ever to have a reliable system. By preparing our text data to be ready for processing at arrival, we eliminate the time needed to do this step downstream. The idea of this project is to demonstrate a practical solution for large datasets that cannot be proessed in-memory in its entirety, and using a cloud data warehousing solution to store and then process that data for NLP tasks. The motiation being that large corpuses of text data becoming extremely valuable to those building LLMs means that we need robust solutions to handle that data and prepare it for tasks that could range from traditional NLP methods to LLM training data.

### Goals
- Build a scalable solution for bringing in large compressed files from S3 which do not fit easily in memory
- Prepare the data for NLP after loading.

## System Architecture
The actual architecture is very basic, we have an EMR cluster reading from S3 in AWS, and writing to snowflake. After which we use snowpark to do our NLP transformations.

### Source Bucket: 
`s3://pipeline-project-data` 
- 

### Data Destination
#### Snowflake
- **Warehouse Configuration**: Detail the Snowflake warehouse setup.
- **Database and Schema**: Specify the database and schema where data will be stored.

## Pipeline Design

### Data Transformation
Detail the transformations needed to prepare the text data for NLP, including:
- Tokenization
- Stop word removal
- Lemmatization or stemming

## Airflow Schedule
- **Frequency**: Define how often the pipeline should run.
- **Trigger**: Outline what will trigger the pipeline (e.g., on a schedule, event-driven).

## Monitoring and Logging
Describe the approach for monitoring the pipeline and logging:
- Airflowâ€™s built-in monitoring tools
- Custom alerts and notifications

## Testing and Validation
Outline the strategy for testing and validating:
- Data integrity checks
- Transformation accuracy

## Deployment and Maintenance
Detail the steps for deploying the pipeline and its maintenance process.

## Security Considerations
Outline the security measures, including:
- Data encryption
- Access controls in S3 and Snowflake
- Secure handling of credentials

## Future Enhancements
Discuss potential enhancements or next steps for the project.
